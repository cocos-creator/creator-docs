# ParticleSystem 3D

Creator added support for 3D particles in v2.3, with basics functions of 3D particle. Features are basically the same as in Creator 3D，but there are differences in version functionalit. We will continue to improve synchronization in the future，align with Creator 3D gradually. The differences are as follows:

1. The particle control playback interface function in the editor is not currently available. You can use the right button to control the particle to accelerate the playback to view the effects in the editor.
2. The StartSize parameter does not provide independent settings for X, Y, Z directions.
3. The StartRotation parameter does not provide independent settings for X, Y, Z directions.
