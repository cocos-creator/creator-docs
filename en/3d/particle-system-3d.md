# 3D Particle System

Cocos Creator has added support for 3D particles in v2.3, with basics functions of 3D particle. There are currently dozens of modules to choose from, including Shape, Color, Velocity, Size, Sequence Frame, Trailing, and so on. But currently some features are not supported and will continue to improved in the future:

1. The switch for particle control preview in the editor is not currently available. You can view the preview effects in the **Scene** panel when the right mouse button is held down.
2. The StartSize parameter does not provide independent settings for X, Y, Z directions.
3. The StartRotation parameter does not provide independent settings for X, Y, Z directions.
