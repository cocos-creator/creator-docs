# C++/Lua Support

__Cocos Creator__ supports JavaScript, built in. Edit your `Scenes` and source code all from within. However, If you are a C++ or Lua developer, __Cocos Creator__ allows exporting of `Scenes` to source code for further development. Why isn't C++ built in, you ask? There is no need to re-invent the wheel. There are many really good development environments out there. Writing a text editor is no trivial task. For this reason, it is best to allow developers to edit source code in the editor of their choice.
