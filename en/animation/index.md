# Animation system

This chapter will introduce the animation system that comes bundled with Cocos Creator. Animation editors usually have the same standard functionality one would expect: standard movement, rotation, scale and sprite animations. Cocos Creator adds to this by providing support for _over-time_ changes of user defined components and custom properties. Also, with a time curve that can be edited arbitrarily and previewing and editing the movement path directly in the scene view, it can help content creators create various exquisite dynamic effects without writing a single line of code.

> **Note**: Cocos Creator's own animation editor is suitable for making some less complex animations that need to be linked with logic, such as UI animations. If you want to create complex effects, character animations, or nested animations, consider using Spine or DragonBones instead.
