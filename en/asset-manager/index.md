# Asset Manager

> Authorï¼šSanty-Wang

During the development of the game, there will be a need to use a lot of resources such as pictures, audio, etc. to enrich the entire game. This is why Creator provides the `Asset Manager` module to help developers manage the use of their resources and improve development efficiency.

The `Asset Manager` is a new module from Creator in v2.4, replacing the previous `cc.loader`. The new `Asset Manager` module implements all resource related functions including loading, querying, destruction, caching, and Asset Bundle, and provides great scalability, allowing you to extend the functionality you need with Asset Manager.

**Note**: The common APIs in `cc.loader` will remain compatible for some time, but we strongly recommend using Asset Manager for new projects.
