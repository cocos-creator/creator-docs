    **Charge**: Agora RTC services use the **prepaid** model. When your service usage exceeds the free portion of the service provider and the account balance is insufficient, the service will be stopped. At that time, you need to **pre-charge** in the Cocos Developer Console. 

After the service is activated, Cocos Service will automatically activate the Agora RTC service, connect the Agora account, and integrate the Agora SDK into the game project.

### Verify whether the service is integrated successfully

- Once the Agora RTC service is integrated, we can verify the success of the Agora RTC service integration by adding simple code to the script.

- Click **Dashboard** button in the Agora RTC service panel, jump to [Agora Console](https://console.agora.io/). Then click ![](agora/agora-projecticon.png) icon in the left navigation menu to enter the Project Management page and obtain the **App ID** of the corresponding game.

- Call the initialize method in the script and fill in the **App ID** obtained from the Agora console:

    ```js
    var appid = 'App ID obtained from the Agora console';
    agora && agora.init(appid);
    ```

- After the script is finished and saved, go back to the editor. Select the **Browser** and click the ![](./image/preview-button.jpg) [Preview](../getting-started/basics/preview-build.md) button. If you can see the initialization log in the browser console, which means the integrate is successful.
