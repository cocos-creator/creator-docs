# Layout component reference

Layout is a container component. The container can unlock the auto-layout function to automatically arrange all the sub-objects according to the specifications so that the user can use it to make list, page turning and other functions conveniently.

| Resize Mode          | Resize strategies, currently has NONE, CHILDREN and CONTAINER.     |
| Padding Left         | The left padding between the sub-object and the container frame in the layout.   |
| Padding Right        | The right padding between the sub-object and the container frame in the layout.  |
| Padding Top          | The top padding between the sub-object and the container frame in the layout.    |
| Padding Bottom       | The bottom padding between the sub-object and the container frame in the layout. |
| Spacing X            | The separation distance between sub-objects in the horizontal layout. NONE mode doesn't have this attribute.   |
| Spacing Y            | The separation distance between sub-objects in the vertical layout. NONE mode doesn't have this attribute.     |
| Horizontal Direction | When it is designated as horizontal layout, which side does the first child node start in the layout? The left or the right?    |
| Vertical Direction   | When it is designated as vertical layout, which side does the first child node start in the layout? The upside or the downside? |
| Cell Size            | This option is only available in Grid layout, Children resize mode. The size of each child element.             |
| Start Axis           | This option is only available in Grid layout, the arrangement direction of children elements.                   |
| Affected By Scale    | Whether the scaling of the child node affects the layout.           |

## Detailed explanation

The default layout type is NONE after adding the Layout component. It indicates that the container won't change size and location of the sub-object. When the user places sub-object manually, the container will take the minimum rectangular region that can contain all the sub-objects as its own size.

You can switch the layout container type by altering `Type` in **Properties** panel, all the layout types support `Resize Mode`.

- When **Resize Mode** is **NONE**, the container and sub-objects' size is independent of each other.

- When **Resize Mode** is **CHILDREN**, the sub-objects' size will change with container's size.

- When **Resize Mode** is **CONTAINER**, the container's size will change with sub-objects' size.

When using Grid layout, the **Start Axis** is very important. When choosing **HORIZONTAL**, it will fill an entire row before a new row is started. When choosing **VERTICAL**, it will fill an entire column before a new column is started.

**Node**:

1. Scaling and rotation of child nodes are not considered.
2. After setting the Layout, the results need to be updated until the next frame, unless you manually call `updateLayout` API.
