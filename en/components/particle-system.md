# Particle System component reference

## Overview

This component is used to read [Particle Resources](../asset-workflow/particle.md) data and perform a series of operations such as play, temporary, destroy, etc.


## Creation method

Editor created:

Click the **Add Component** button at the bottom of the **Properties** panel and select `Particle System` from `Add Rendering Component` to add the Particle System component to the node.

Script creation:

```js
// Create a node
var node = new cc.Node();
// And add nodes to the scene
c.director.getScene().addChild(node);
// And add particle components to Node
var particleSystem = node.adComponent(cc.ParticleSystem);
// Next you can particleSystem this object for a series of operations
```

Please refer to the script interface of the Particle System [Particle System API](../../../api/en/classes/ParticleSystem.html)ã€‚

## Note

At present, due to the performance of Color rendering for each particle texture in Canvas, it is very expensive. So it is recommended that under Canvas rendering mode, the number of particles should not be too large, and try to keep it within 200, otherwise it will cause runtime very stuck.
