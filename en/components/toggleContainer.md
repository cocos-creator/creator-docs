# ToggleContainer component reference

ToggleContainer is not a visiable UI component but a way to modify the behavior of a set of Toggles. Toggles that belong to the same group could only have one of them to be switched on at a time.

> **Note**: all the first layer child node containing the toggle component will auto be added to the container
