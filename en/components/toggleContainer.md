# ToggleContainer component reference

ToggleContainer is not a visiable UI component but a way to modify the behavior of a set of Toggles.
Toggles that belong to the same group could only have one of them to be switched on at a time.

Note: All the first layer child node containing the toggle component will auto be added to the container

The API reference of ToggleContainer is here: [ToggleContainer API](../../../api/en/classes/toggleContainer.html)ã€‚
