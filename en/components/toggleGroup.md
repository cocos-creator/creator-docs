# ToggleGroup component reference

**Node**: ToggleGroup is deprecated, please use [ToggleContainer](toggleContainer.md) instead.

ToggleGroup is not a visiable UI component but a way to modify the behavior of a set of Toggles.
Toggles that belong to the same group could only have one of them to be switched on at a time.
