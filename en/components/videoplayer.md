Click **Add Component** at the bottom of **Properties** panel and select **VideoPlayer** from **UI Component** to add the VideoPlayer component to the node.

For more information about VideoPlayer's scripting interface, please refer to [VideoPlayer API](../../../api/en/classes/VideoPlayer.html).

| Video Player Event| the video player's callback, it will be triggered when certain event occurs. Please refer to the `VideoPlayer Event` section below or [VideoPlayerEvent API](../../../api/en/classes/VideoPlayer.html#videoplayerevent) for more details.

**Note**：In **cc.Node** of the **Video Player Event** property, you should fill in a Node that hangs the user script component, and in the user script you can use the relevant VideoPlayer event according to the user's needs.

## VideoPlayer Event

### VideoPlayerEvent Event

| Properties |   Function Explanation
| -------------- | ----------- |
| target          | Node with the script component.
| component       | Script component name.
| handler         | Specify a callback，when the video player is about to playing or paused, it will be called. There is a parameter in the callback which indicate the state of played videos.
| customEventData | The user specifies that any string is passed in as the last parameter of the event callback |

For more information, please refer to [Component.EventHandler Class](../../../api/en/classes/Component.EventHandler.html).

### Parameter of VideoPlayerEvent

| Name           | Function Explanation          |
| -------------- | -----------                   |
| PLAYING        | Video is playing.             |
| PAUSED         | Video is paused.              |
| STOPPED        | Video is stopped.             |
| COMPLETED      | Video is completed.           |
| META_LOADED    | Video's meta data is loaded.  |
| CLICKED        | Video is clicked by the user. |
| READY_TO_PLAY  | Video is ready to play.       |

**Note**: On iOS platform, due to the platform limitations, the CLICKED event can't be fired when VideoPlayer is in fullscreen mode. If you want to let the Video played in fullscreen and also fire the CLICKED event properly, you should use a Widget component to hack the VideoPlayer's size.

For more information, please refer to the [VideoPlayer Events](../../../api/en/classes/VideoPlayer.html#events) or [09_videoplayer](https://github.com/cocos-creator/example-cases/tree/master/assets/cases/02_ui/09_videoplayer) of the example-cases samples bundled with Creator.

## Detailed Explanation

Currently this component is only available on Web (Both PC and Mobile), iOS and Android (Not supported in the v2.0.0~2.0.6). You can't use it on Mac or Windows which means if you preview VideoPlayer on these platforms, there is nothing to show.

The supported video types are determined by the supported OS, in order to make it works across all the supported platforms, we suggest to use mp4 format.

### Add a callback via script

#### Method one

This method uses the same API that editor uses to add an event callback on Button component. You need to construct a `cc.Component.EventHandler` object first, and then set the corresponding `target`, `component`, `handler` and `customEventData` parameters.

```js
var videoPlayerEventHandler = new cc.Component.EventHandler();
videoPlayerEventHandler.target = this.node; // This Node node is the one to which your event-handling code component belongs
videoPlayerEventHandler.component = "cc.MyComponent"
videoPlayerEventHandler.handler = "callback";
videoPlayerEventHandler.customEventData = "foobar";

videoPlayer.videoPlayerEvent.push(videoPlayerEventHandler);

// here is your component file
cc.Class({
    name: 'cc.MyComponent'
    extends: cc.Component,

    properties: {
    },

	//the order of parameters should not change
    callback: function(videoplayer, eventType, customEventData) {
        //videoplayer is a VideoPlayer component instance
        //eventType is typed as cc.VideoPlayer.EventType 
        //customEventData is "foobar"
    }
});
```

#### Method two

Add event callback with `videoplayer.node.on('ready-to-play', ...)`

```js
// Suppose we add event handling callbacks in the onLoad method of a component and perform event handling in the callback function:

cc.Class({
    extends: cc.Component,

    properties: {
       videoplayer: cc.VideoPlayer
    },

    onLoad: function () {
       this.videoplayer.node.on('ready-to-play', this.callback, this);
    },

    callback: function (event) {
       //event is EventCustom, you can use event.detail to get VideoPlayer component
       var videoplayer = event.detail;
       //do whatever you want with videoplayer
       //you can't pass customEventData in this way
    }
});
```

Likewise, you can also register `meta-loaded`, `clicked`, `playing` events, and the parameters of the callback function for these events are consistent with the `read-to-play` parameters.

## Support platform

Because different platforms have different authorization, API and control methods for VideoPlayer component. And have not yet formed a unified standard, only **Web**, **iOS**, and **Android** platforms are currently supported. If you need to use VideoPlayer on the WeChat Mini Game, you can refer to the [WeChat Mini Game API Documentation](https://developers.weixin.qq.com/minigame/en/dev/api/media/video/wx.createVideo.html).
