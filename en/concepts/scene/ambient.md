# Ambient light

In life, the intricate light patterns and uneven surfaces reflect each other, so that the entire environment is illuminated, as if the entire scene is enveloped by a layer of ambient light. Adjusting the amount of __ambient light__ is the most direct way to adjust the overall illumination of the environment. It is also one way to effectively express the atmosphere of the environment.
