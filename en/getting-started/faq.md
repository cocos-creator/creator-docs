This is due to the color channel and background colors did the interpolation when bilinear filtering, the simpler way is to use the pre-multiply. Pre-multiplication requires that the blending mode of the Sprite component be set to `SRC: ONE, DST: ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA`, and then process the original image.

There are two ways to deal with the original, one is to add a black background under the color channel when the picture is exported, and the transparent channel remains unchanged. The other way is to call `texture.update({premultiplyAlpha: true})` to texture in code, if the call fails, it may be an older version of Creator and the old version needs to use `texture.handleLoadedTexture(true)`.
