## What's New

- **As of v2.4.0**, Cocos Creator has completely rewritten the Resource Management module, and it's compatible with most of the previously used APIs, so most projects will still work under existing code, but some projects may receive some warnings. In both cases, developers are advised to upgrade to the latest resource management module.See [v2.4 Asset Manager Upgrade Guide](release-notes/asset-manager-upgrade-guide.md) and [v2.4 Subpackage upgrade guide](release-notes/subpackage-upgrade-guide.md) for details.
