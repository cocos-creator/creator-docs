Click the **Add Component -> Physics Component -> Constant Force 3D** button at the bottom of the **Properties** panel to add the ConstantForce component to the node.

It should be noted that when adding a ConstantForce component, the [RigidBody component](./physics-rigidbody.md) is also automatically added to the node and cannot be deleted.
