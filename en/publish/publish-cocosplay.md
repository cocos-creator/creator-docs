The specific filling rules for the relevant parameter configuration are as follows:

- **Custom game package path**

  This item is optional. You can customize the directory in which the `.cpk` (generated after the build) is stored. If not set, the `.cpk` is generated to the release package `build/cocos-play` directory by default.

- **Resource Server Address**

  This entry fills in the address at which the resource is stored on the server and is optional:

  - If this entry is not filled, the **remote** folder in the **build** directory will be packaged in the **cpk** package.

  - If this entry is filled in, the built **cpk** package will not include the **remote** folder and you will need to manually upload the **remote** folder to the filled in resource server address.

  For specific resource management details, see [Resource Management for Cocos Play Environment](#resource-management-for-cocos-play-environment).

### 2. Build

After the build is completed, click the **Open** button behind the **Build Path** to open the build release package. You can see that the **cocos-play** directory is generated under the default release path `build` directory, which is the exported Cocos Play game project directory and **.cpk** file, the **cpk** package is in the `build/cocos-play` directory. If you have set a **Custom game package path**, the **cpk** package will be generated into the specified directory.

## Resource Management for Cocos Play Environment

**Cocos Play** is similar to **WeChat Mini Game**. There are restrictions on the package size. The main package size limit for Cocos Play is **10MB**, more than that must be downloaded via a network request.

We recommend that developers save only the script files in the package and download all other resources from the remote server. Cocos Creator already helps developers with downloading, caching and version management of remote resources. The specific implementation logic and operation steps are similar to the WeChat Mini Game. Please refer to the [Resource Management for WeChat Mini Game](./publish-wechatgame.md#resource-management-for-wechat-mini-game-environment) documentation for details.
