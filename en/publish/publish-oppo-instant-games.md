# Publish to OPPO Mini Games

## Environment Configuration

- Download [OPPO Mini Game Debugger](https://cdofs.oppomobile.com/cdo-activity/static/201810/26/quickgame/documentation/games/use.html) and install it on your Android device (Android Phone 6.0 or above is recommended)

- Install [nodejs-8.1.4](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or above, globally

- Determine whether you need to install [Debugging Tools](https://cdofs.oppomobile.com/cdo-activity/static/201810/26/quickgame/documentation/games/use.html) according to your own development needs.

## Release Process

1. Use __Cocos Creator__ to open the project that needs to be released. Select **OPPO Mini Game** in the **Platform** dropdown of the **Build...** panel.

    ![](./publish-oppo-instant-games/build_option.png)

The specific filling rules for the relevant parameter configuration are as follows:

- **Game Package Name**

  **Game Package Name** is filled in according to the user's needs. It's required.

- **Game Name**

  **Game Name**, the name of the OPPO Mini Game, is required. And the **Title** at the top of the **Build** panel does not participate in the OPPO mini game packaging process.

- **Desktop Icon**

  **Desktop Icon** is required. Click the **...** button at the back of the input box to select the icon you want. When building, the Desktop Icon will be built into the __OPPO Mini Game__ project. Desktop Icon suggest using PNG pictures.

- **Game Version Name**

  This item is required. **Game Version Name** is the real version, such as: 1.0.0.

- **Game Version Number**

  This item is required. **Game Version Number** is different from the **Game Version Name**, and the **Game Version Number** is mainly used to distinguish the version update. Each time when you submit audit, the game version number is at least 1 higher than the value of the last submitted audit. It must not be equal to or less than the value of the last submitted audit, and it is recommended that the **Game Version Number** be recursively incremented by 1 each time when the audit is submitted. **Note**: The **Game Version Number** must be a positive integer.

- **Supported Minimum Platform Version Number**

  This item is required. According to the requirements of OPPO Mini Games, this value must be greater than or equal to **1031** at present.

- **Resource Server Address**

  This entry fills in the address at which the resource is stored on the server and is optional:

  - If this entry is not filled, the **remote** folder in the **build** directory will be packaged in the **rpk** package.

  - If this entry is filled in, the built **rpk** package will not include the **remote** folder and you will need to manually upload the **remote** folder to the filled in resource server address.

  For specific resource management details, see [Resource Management for OPPO Mini Game Environment](#resource-management-for-oppo-mini-game-environment).

- **Keystore**

  When you check the **Keystore**, the default is to build the rpk package with a certificate that comes with Creator, which is used only for **debugging**. **Note**: When the rpk package is to be used to submit an audit, do not check the **Keystore** to build it.

  If you don't check the **Keystore**, you need to configure the signature files **certificate.pem path** and **private.pem path**, where you build a rpk package that you can **publish directly**. The user can configure two signature files by using the **...** button to the right of the input box. **Note**: These two signature files are not recommended to be placed in the **build/quickgame** directory of the publish package, otherwise the build directory will be emptied each time when it is built, resulting in file loss.

  There are two ways to generate a signature files:

    - Generated by the **New** button after the **certificate.pem path** in the **Build** panel.

    - Generated by the command line.

      The user needs to generate the signature file **private.pem**, **certificate.pem** through tools such as **openssl**.

      ```bash
      # Generate a signature file with the openssl command tool
      openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout private.pem   -x509 -days 3650 -out certificate.pem
      ```

      **Note**: **openssl** can be opened directly in the terminal in Linux or Mac environment, and in the Windows environment you need to install `openssl` and configure system environment variables. Restart Creator after the configuration is complete.

- **Custom npm folder path**

  This item is optional. Starting with **v2.0.10**, the global npm of the operating system can be automatically obtained and without manual setting. The way to obtain npm is:

  - **Windows**: Gets the path in the environment variable from the system.
  - **Mac**: Gets the path in the environment variable from the configuration file of Shell.

  If not, make sure the npm is properly installed and can be started directly in the command line environment. The obtained npm is used to provide an environment for building rpk. If the npm folder path cannot be found at building, __Cocos Creator__ will only export the game project directory and will not generate the rpk package.

  The npm filling rules below **v2.0.10** are as follows:

  - If you do not fill out this item, the Creator will read the npm path in the environment variable by default on the Windows system, and the npm in the **/usr/bin/local** directory is read by default on the Mac system to build the exported mini game rpk package that can be run.
  - If your PC environment does not have npm installed or cannot read the npm path in the system, you will need to fill out the **Custom npm folder path** to build and exported rpk package. Fill in the rules as follows:

    - Windows system

      ```bash
      # Get local npm folder path
      where npm
      # If the output is
      C:\Program Files\nodejs\npm
      # Then the local npm folder path is filled in as:
      C:\Program Files\nodejs
      ```

    - Mac system

      ```bash
      # Get local npm folder path
      which npm
      # If the output is
      /Users/yourname/.nvm/versions/node/v8.1.4/bin/npm
      # Then the local npm folder path is filled in as:
      /Users/yourname/.nvm/versions/node/v8.1.4/bin
      ```

**2. Build**

After the relevant parameters of the **Build** panel are set, click **Build**. After the build is complete, click the **Open** button behind the **Build Path** to open the build release package. You can see that the **quickgame** directory is generated under the default release path `build` directory, which is the exported OPPO Mini Game project directory and **rpk**, **rpk** package are in the __/build/quickgame/dist__ directory.

**3. Run the built rpk to the phone**

Copy the generated mini-game **rpk** file (located in the dist directory of the OPPO minigame project's quickgame directory) to the `/sdcard/games/` directory on your phone's SD card. Then open the **Mini Game Debugger** that has been installed before on the Android device, click the **OPPO Mini Game** section, and then find the icon corresponding to the game name. If not found, click on the "More -> Refresh" button in the upper right corner to refresh.

![](./publish-oppo-instant-games/rpk_games.jpg)

**4. Subpackage rpk**

Subpackage loading, that is, splitting the game content into several packages according to certain rules, only downloading the necessary packages when starting up for the first time. This necessary package is called **main package**, and the developer can trigger in the main package to download other sub-packages, which can effectively reduce the time spent on the first boot. To use this function, you need to set [Subpackage Configuration](../scripting/asset-bundle.md) in __Cocos Creator__, and the package will be automatically subpackaged when the setting is completed.

After the build is complete, the subpackage directory is in the `/build/quickgame/dist` directory. <br>
In this case, you need to create a new **subPkg** directory in the **sdcard** directory of the Android device, and then copy the **.rpk** file in the `/build/quickgame/dist` directory to the **subPkg** directory.

Then switch to the **Package Load** section of **Mini Game Debugger**, click Refresh at the top right to see the game name of the subpackage, click **Second Open** to use the same as the normal packaged **rpk**.

![](./publish-oppo-instant-games/run_subpackage.jpg)

**Note**: Subpackage rpk needs to be copied to the `/sdcard/subPkg/` directory of Android devices, and non-subpackage rpk needs to be copied to the `/sdcard/games/` directory of Android devices, both of which cannot be mixed.

## Resource Management for OPPO Mini Game Environment

**OPPO Mini Game** is similar to **WeChat Mini Game**. There are restrictions on the package size. The main package size limit for OPPO Mini Game is **10MB**, more than that must be downloaded via a network request.

We recommend that developers save only the script files in the package and download all other resources from the remote server. Cocos Creator already helps developers with downloading, caching and version management of remote resources. The specific implementation logic and operation steps are similar to the WeChat Mini Game. Please refer to the [Resource Management for WeChat Mini Game](./publish-wechatgame.md#resource-management-for-wechat-mini-game-environment) documentation for details.
