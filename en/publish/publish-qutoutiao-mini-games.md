# Publish to QTT Mini Games

Starting with Cocos Creator v2.3.0, creating games for the QTT Mini Games is officially supported.

## Environment Configuration

- Download [QTT APP](https://game.qutoutiao.net/doc/index.html#/doc/debug_in_app) and install it on your Android device (Android Phone 6.0 or above is recommended).

## Release Process

1. Use **Cocos Creator** to open the project that needs to be released. Select **QTT Mini Game** in the **Platform** dropdown of the **Build...** panel.

The specific filling rules for the relevant parameter configuration are as follows:

- **Game Package Name**

  **Game Package Name** is filled in according to the user's needs. It's required.

- **Game Name**

  **Game Name**, the name of the QTT Mini Game, is required. And the **Title** at the top of the **Build** panel does not participate in the QTT Mini Game packaging process.

- **Desktop Icon**

  **Desktop Icon** is required. Click the **...** button at the back of the input box to select the icon you want. When building, the Desktop Icon will be built into the **QTT Mini Game** project. Desktop Icon suggest using PNG pictures.

- **Game Version Name**

  This item is required. **Game Version Name** is the real version, such as: 1.0.0.

- **Game Version Number**

  This item is required. **Game Version Number** is different from the **Game Version Name**, and the **Game Version Number** is mainly used to distinguish the version update. Each time when you submit audit, the Game Version Number is at least 1 higher than the value of the last submitted audit. It must not be equal to or less than the value of the last submitted audit, and it is recommended that the **Game Version Number** be recursively incremented by 1 each time when the audit is submitted. **Note**: The **Game Version Number** must be a positive integer.

- **Small Packet Mode**

  This item is optional. The package size of a mini game depends on the volume of code and static resources contained in the game package. Regardless of whether the small package mode is selected, the volume of the game package cannot exceed 4M after the package is generated. If it is greater than this volume limit, you should consider using the small packet mode. In QTT Mini Games environment, resources can be loaded via network requests. **Small Packet Mode** is to help users keep the script files in the mini game package, other resources are uploaded to the remote server, and downloaded from the remote server as needed. And the download, cache and version management of remote resources, Cocos Creator has already done that for developers. What the developer needs to do are the following steps:

  - When building, check the **Small Packet Mode** and fill in the **Small Packet Mode Server Path**.

  - **First game resource package into the game package**

      In the Small Packet Mode, due to too many resources on the launch scene, downloading and loading resources for a long time may result in a short black screen when entering the game for the first time. If **First game resource package into the game package** is checked, you can reduce the black screen time when you first enter the game. However, it should be noted that the `res/import` resource does not support split resource downloading at this time, and the entire `import` directory is also packaged into the first package.

      Developers can choose whether to check this item according to their needs. Then click on **Build**.

  - After the build is complete, click the **Open** button after the **Build Path** to upload the **qtt-game/res** directory under the release path to the packet mode server. For example, if the default publishing path is `build`, you need to upload the **build/qtt-game/res** directory.

  At this point, the **res** folder will no longer be included in the `.rpk` file which is generated after the build, and the resources in the **res** folder will be downloaded from the filled **Small Packet Mode Server Path** through the network request.

**2. Build**

After the relevant parameters of the **Build** panel are set, click **Build**. After the build is complete, click the **Open** button behind the **Build Path** to open the build release package. You can see that the **qtt-game** directory is generated under the default release path `build` directory, which is the exported QTT Mini Game project directory and **rpk**, the **rpk** package is in the **/build/qtt-game** directory.

- Open **game 包本地化开关** in the **Cocos 实验室** page, and you can see a file path displayed below. Then rename the cpk package generated by the **build** to `game_debug.cpk`, and place it under the file path of the Android device. **debug 开关** and **vconsole 开关** can be turned on or off as required.

- Fill in the applied **appid** and **game 版本号**

  **appid** is the applied game ID, which can be filled in at will in the debug environment.<br>
