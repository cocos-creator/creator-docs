# Publish to QTT Mini Games

Starting with Cocos Creator v2.3.0, creating games for the QTT Mini Games is officially supported.

## Environment Configuration

- Download [QTT APP](https://game.qutoutiao.net/doc/index.html#/doc/debug_in_app) and install it on your Android device (Android Phone 6.0 or above is recommended).

## Release Process

1. Use **Cocos Creator** to open the project that needs to be released. Select **QTT Mini Game** in the **Platform** dropdown of the **Build...** panel.

The specific filling rules for the relevant parameter configuration are as follows:

- **Game Package Name**

  **Game Package Name** is filled in according to the user's needs. It's required.

- **Game Name**

  **Game Name**, the name of the QTT Mini Game, is required. And the **Title** at the top of the **Build** panel does not participate in the QTT Mini Game packaging process.

- **Desktop Icon**

  **Desktop Icon** is required. Click the **...** button at the back of the input box to select the icon you want. When building, the Desktop Icon will be built into the **QTT Mini Game** project. Desktop Icon suggest using PNG pictures.

- **Game Version Name**

  This item is required. **Game Version Name** is the real version, such as: 1.0.0.

- **Game Version Number**

  This item is required. **Game Version Number** is different from the **Game Version Name**, and the **Game Version Number** is mainly used to distinguish the version update. Each time when you submit audit, the Game Version Number is at least 1 higher than the value of the last submitted audit. It must not be equal to or less than the value of the last submitted audit, and it is recommended that the **Game Version Number** be recursively incremented by 1 each time when the audit is submitted. **Note**: The **Game Version Number** must be a positive integer.

- **Resource Server Address**

  This entry fills in the address at which the resource is stored on the server and is optional:

  - If this entry is not filled, the **remote** folder in the build directory will be packaged in the cpk package.

  - If this entry is filled in, the built rpk package will not include the **remote** folder and you will need to manually upload the **remote** folder to the filled in resource server address.

  For specific resource management details, see [Resource Management for QTT Mini Game Environment](#resource-management-for-qtt-mini-game-environment).

**2. Build**

After the relevant parameters of the **Build** panel are set, click **Build**. After the build is complete, click the **Open** button behind the **Build Path** to open the build release package. You can see that the **qtt-game** directory is generated under the default release path `build` directory, which is the exported QTT Mini Game project directory and **rpk**, the **rpk** package is in the **/build/qtt-game** directory.

- Fill in the applied **appid** and **game 版本号**

  **appid** is the applied game ID, which can be filled in at will in the debug environment.<br>
  **game 版本号** is the version characteristic value of the game package, normally generated by the platform. Here used for debugging purposes, and it is generally a random string of letters and numbers. **Note**: A new value is re-entered for each replacement package.

- After setting, click the **打开游戏** button below to open the game. **Note**: If you want to open the game again, you need to re-place the cpk package in the file path described above.

## Resource Management for QTT Mini Game Environment

**QTT Mini Game** is similar to **WeChat Mini Game**. There are restrictions on the package size. Resources over **4MB** must be downloaded via a network request.

We recommend that developers save only the script files in the package and download all other resources from the remote server. Cocos Creator already helps developers with downloading, caching and version management of remote resources. The specific implementation logic and operation steps are similar to the WeChat Mini game. Please refer to the [Resource Management for WeChat Mini Game](./publish-wechatgame.md#resource-management-for-wechat-mini-game-environment) documentation for details.
