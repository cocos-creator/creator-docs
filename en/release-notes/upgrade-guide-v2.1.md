# Cocos Creator v2.1.0 Release Notes

Cocos Creator **v2.1**, adds support for 3D features such as: **3D model rendering**, **3D Camera**, **3D skeletal animation**, and **3D point selection**. The Cocos Creator editor now natively supports parsing 3D model files of type **FBX format**. It's that simple, no additional import workflow is required!

In the previous v2.0, Cocos Creator had used a Cocos3D based 3D renderer. With this foundation, 3D support could officially be introduced. The addition of 3D features can greatly enrich the expressiveness of 2D games, reduce the resource overhead of 2D games, and bring more imagination and ideas to expand games.

However, it should be emphasized that the target users of Cocos Creator is still the 2D game development team, and the **2D game is still the core service goal of Cocos Creator 2.x releases**. We will continue to optimize the development experience and basic performance of 2D games, and gradually increase the 3D functions suitable for integration into 2D games. Therefore, Cocos Creator will not become a pure 3D engine, which is the goal of Cocos3D. Cocos Creator's roadmap is closer to 2.5D.

This is not the first time Cocos has upgraded the engine from 2D to 3D. A few years ago, Cocos2d-x expanded to the 3D space and accumulated a lot of experience. It also produced a very good game called **Art of Conquest**. However, at that time, 3D functions were piled up on a very heavy 2D renderer. There was also no editor support. It was not widely recognized by the market. This time, Cocos Creator is based on Cocos3D's 3D renderer, which has a lot of 3D stability and guarantees a seamless editor experience.

## Follow-up Version Notice

**v2.0 will continue to be maintained, native platform performance will be optimized as soon as possible**

v2.0 and v2.1 will grow together over a period of time. V2.0 will continue to be maintained, adding more performance optimizations and bug fixes. We will soon be beta testing v2.0.7. In v2.0.7 the rendering performance of the engine has been optimized, especially **Spine** and **DragonBones**. Also, the performance has been greatly improved.

**v2.1 iterations will be more aggressive**

Compared with v2.0, the upgrade cycle of v2.1 will mainly focus on 3D features. We recommend upgrading new projects with 3D requirements to this version, and establishing contact with us on our forums. This allows us and our 3D partners to provide support. Since v2.1 is a very new version, we will speed up the iteration and try to meet the needs of developers. In particular, **currently v2.1.0 version still does not support 3D scene editing, only the 3D parameters can be set in Properties**. We will be releasing **v2.1.1** in the near future which will support *3D scene editing*, *material systems* and *optimizing the 3D development process*.

## Complete list of changes (compared to v2.0.5)

### What's New

#### 3D Node

In v2.1, newly created **Nodes** are still 2D by default. When needed, you only need to click the 2.5D button at the top right of the **Node** to switch to **3D mode**. After switching, you can edit the **z axis**. See [3D Node](../3d/3d-node.md).

You can watch converting to **3D Nodes** in action:

#### 3D Camera

Like **Node**, **Camera** is also divided into two modes. When you add a **Camera** component to a normal 2D node, it becomes a 2D Camera. When you switch **Node** to **3D mode**, **Camera** will also enter **3D mode**, and then you can edit **Camera's** **FOV** and other parameters in **3D mode**.

You can watch switching to **3D Camera** in action:

#### 3D Model Import

Currently, Cocos Creator supports importing the **.fbx** format of 3D models. **.fbx** is the de-facto standard in 3D modeling software. The process of importing is very simple, just drag the **.fbx** model resources into the **Assets** and wait a few moments for the import to complete. After the import is completed, you can see that the imported model is a folder that can be expanded in **Assets**. When importing the model, the editor will automatically parse the content of the model and generates resources such as **Prefab Meshes** and **Skeletal Animations** and so on. See [Import Models](../3d/import-model.md)

#### Mesh Renderer Component

Mesh Renderer is used to draw grid resources. See [Mesh Renderer](../3d/mesh-renderer.md).

![](../3d/img/mesh_renderer.png)

#### Skeletal Animation Component

The **Skeletal Animation** component inherits from the **Animation** component. Using the **Skeletal Animation** component is not much different from how you would use the **Animation** component. The exception is the **Skeletal Animation** component uses a clip that can only be a **Skeletal Animation** clip. The **Skeletal Animation** component is automatically added to the model's Prefab when it is imported. See [Skeletal Animation Component](../3d/skeleton-animation.md) for details.

For more 3D instructions, please consult the documentation [3D System](../3d/index.md).

#### Optimize Auto Atlas Build Speed

v2.1 greatly optimizes the speed of Auto Atlas construction. If the atlas has not changed, the results of the last build are used.

#### Further Improve Rendering Performance

Between v2.0 compared to v1.x, there are some cases where the engine does not render batches, resulting in an increase in Draw Calls. v2.1 re-optimized these conditions. For example: the previous **color** or **opacity** cannot be batch processed, **sliced** and **non-sliced** share the same texture and cannot be batched. The problem that the **opacity** 0 node still occupies the Draw Call is solved.

#### Add Simulator Debugging Function

In the **Settings -> Preview Run** panel, the **Open simulator debugger panel** option and the **Wait for debugger connect** option have been added. The purpose of the **Open simulator debugger panel** option is to automatically open the debug window when the simulator previews the project. The **Wait for debugger connect** option is used to suspend the boot process until the debugger connection is complete for debugging the load process.

#### Texture Auto Compression

The compression required by the texture can be set directly in the editor, and Cocos Creator will automatically compress the texture when the project is published. Exporting multiple image formats simultaneously on the web is supported. The engine will automatically download the appropriate format according to the different browsers. See [Compressed Textures](../asset-workflow/compress-texture.md) for details.
