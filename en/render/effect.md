Another way is to select the folder in the **Assets** panel where you want to store the Effects, then right-click and select **Create -> Effect**.

## Usage of Effect

1. After creating the Effect, select the New Effect in the **Assets** panel, and you can preview the compiled `glsl` code in the **Properties** panel.

## Rules for writing

Cocos Creator's Effect writing rules is consistent with Cocos Creator 3D, it can be written using VS Codeâ€™s Cocos Effect plugin, but the built-in shader variable names are slightly different. Please refer to the [Documentation](https://docs.cocos.com/creator3d/manual/en/material-system/overview.html) for details.
